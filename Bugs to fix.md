## Fixed Bugs :

melee attacks only working on the left side



## Bugs :

### 1 - Jumping collision
there is __no collision__ between the player and those things that we had a bug with before\
**( the player can jump throught them )**


### 2- enemy get stuck with the red flow ( try the lunch the game and observe )
